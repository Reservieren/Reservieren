- 👋 Hi, I'm @Reservieren.  I write code.  Sometimes it even works.
- 👀 I’m interested in avoiding meetings. Also, occasionally, in finishing projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to cope with the existential dread of being a software engineer.  My tech stack is a constantly shifting landscape of libraries I'll probably have to rewrite next year anyway.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that are well-documented (lol) and don't involve legacy code (double lol).  If you have a project that's less than 5 years old and doesn't require a PhD to understand, hit me up.
- 📫 How to reach me: [you cant] (Please be brief. I have limited bandwidth for human interaction.)
- 😄 Pronouns: 𓅻𓀎𓀴 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've debugged code so complex, it made me question the meaning of life.  I've also seen code so bad, it made me question humanity.
